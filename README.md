# Serverless Web Applications with React and Firebase
This is the code repository for [Serverless Web Applications with React and Firebase](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/serverless-web-applications-react-and-firebase?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788477413), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Realtime applications have dominated the field of web applications for years. Real time isn't limited to only displaying data as soon as it's available; it shows its real power when used with interactive experiences, in which users and systems can instantly communicate with one another. With features such as virtual DOM and declarative views, React proves to be a better fit for such Realtime applications. Firebase makes building and rapid-prototyping these kinds of applications simpler by letting you focus on how the application should behave and look, without getting bogged down in the more tedious parts of Realtime development.

This book will cover the Firebase features such as Cloud Storage, Cloud Function, Hosting, and Realtime Database integration with React to develop rich, collaborative, real-time applications using only client-side code. We can also see how we can secure our application using Firebase Authentication and Database Security Rules. We also leverage the power of Redux to organize the data in the frontend. Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. Toward the end of the book, you will have improved your React skills by realizing the potential of Firebase to create real-time serverless web applications.

This book provides more practical insights rather than just theoretical concepts and includes basic to advanced examples—from hello world to a realtime Web Application.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
constructor(props) {
 super(props);
 this.state = {
 value: props.initialValue
 };
 }
```

You should have basic programming experience with React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to read this book profitably. It is assumed that you know already how Node Package Manager (npm) works to install any dependencies, and you have a basic idea about ES6 Syntax.
